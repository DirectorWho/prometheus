# Prometheus, a Drupal Installation Profile
This is an installation profile that is meant as a starter for designers and frontend developers. It includes a lot of configuration that is common to Drupal sites - things like WYSIWYG, views, basic responsive styles and more. This profile is under active development. If you'd like to help, feel free to get in touch with me.

A demo of this site is [here](http://dev-prometheus.gotpantheon.com/).
